##### NOTE: This is a mirror of the HadesMem library primarily developed by RaptorFactor (Joshua Boyce)

# HadesMem
HadesMem is a C++-based memory editing library for Windows based applications, with the goal of providing a safe, generic, powerful, and efficient API.

# License
HadesMem is licensed under the MIT License (as of v2.0.0). Dependencies are under their respective (different) licenses. Please respect all license agreements.

# Important Note
You are currently viewing the bleeding edge build. Links to previous versions can be found at the project's old home on Google Code (https://code.google.com/p/hadesmem/).

# Help
No documentation is currently available for master as the API is still sort-of in a state of flux. Once I've finished the remaining major API changes I will write documentation and then tweak it as needed until the API is locked down with SemVer. In the meantime you are welcome to contact me directly with any questions you may have, replies may be slow occasionally but rest assured I will respond (if I don't please email me again because it means it got caught in a spam filter or something, I promise I'm not ignoring you). My email address is raptorfactor@raptorfactor.com.
